This application provides a way for the user to build their own workout using exercises as components. This lets the user fully customize their workout plan. If this project was fully realized, each exercise would have its own video tutorial and/or instructions on how to perform it.

The app is made up of 3 components, not including App. ItemCard is used to display each exercise and its properties, and also has a button that lets the user add it to their "cart". For its props it takes in the exercise's properties (name, image URL, etc.) to display the info on the card, and uses addItem (which is attached to a button, onClick) to add an exercise to the cart (cartData). FilterSortBar allows the user to filter and sort the exercises. It takes in 4 functions as props to allow the user to sort the data by calorie burn, reset the sort, and select filters. These actions are passed back to App.js where states are set to modify itemData (affected by sort) and filteredData (affected by filters), which define which exercises are rendered on the interface. BuiltWorkout displays the items in the "cart" and takes in cartData (used to show the items in the cart), totCalories (used to display the total number of calories burned by the exercises in the cart), and remItem (used to remove items from itemData).

I tried to keep the hierarchy simple. I wanted the icon for the "cart" to be easily accessible and visible at all times, which is why it has a fixed position. The exercises are divided into cards so that the relevant information is obviously lumped together. The name of the exercise is the biggest because it's the most important and informative piece of information. The filter and sort options come just after the name of the app to make them easy to find. I used radio buttons for sort and the filter because the user should only select one of the options. I used checkboxes for the second filter to indicate that the user can select multiple options. I used an OffCanvas Bootstrap component for the cart so that it doesn't take up too much space on the page when the user doesn't want to focus on its contents.
